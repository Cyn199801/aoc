# Advent of Code 2018

This was my first year participating in the [Advent Of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018), an Advent calendar of programming
puzzles. I was able to complete all of the problems, finishing each one on the
day it was released. It was great fun and I hope to continue participating in
the event going forward.

## Notable Problems

The standout problem was #15, the hardest of the bunch in my opinion. It's
a simulation of goblins and elves in a cave, using breadth first search for
pathfinding algorithms and a strict specification.

## My Approach

I wrote my first ever [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) program to solve Day 1.
I stuck with elixir for the first week, but after about that I was reaching the
limit of my capabilities in that language. For the rest of the competition,
I fell back to Ruby - even though it's not the language I have the greatest
amount of experience in, it's still one of the most comfortable languages for me
to use.

Days 1-7 have writeups in their own directories in the README.md file.

- Day 1: 2 stars: Elixir
- Day 2: 2 stars: Elixir, Javascript
- Day 3: 2 stars: Elixir, Ruby
- Day 4: 2 stars: Elixir
- Day 5: 2 stars: Elixir, Ruby
- Day 6: 2 stars: Elixir, Ruby
- Day 7-25: 2 stars: Ruby
