# Day 13: Packet Scanners

## Approach and Reflections

We're given a description of a firewall with "layers" and "security scanners".
Each layer is a 1d grid with a different depth, and each scanner is bouncing
up and down that layer as time passes. For part 1, we need to determine at
what steps a packet gliding through the top layers gets "caught" by a scanner.
For part2, we need to find the shortest amount of delay to wait before we can
send a packet through without being caught.

This problem took an approach that's becoming increasingly familiar to me for
Advent of Code problems. Describe a process, iterated in steps that can be
simulated in data structures easily for part 1. Then, for part 2, make the
numbers so large that it won't run in a reasonable amount of time. You'll
either need to optimize or to switch to a new, math based approach instead of
simulation based.

I wrote a simulation, but couldn't get past part 2 without adding the
following basic optimizations:

- When calculating layers after delays, remember the previous layers instead
  of starting from scratch. If we are to try the layers after a 1,000
  nanosecond delay, remember what they looked like after a 999 delay and
  increment once. (Don't start from 0 and step 1,000 times).
- As soon as you detect a packet is caught by a scanner, stop simulating.
  What happens in the future doesn't matter, since that delay is no longer
  a possible answer.

This got me the answer in about 2 minutes of runtime.

Then, I was able to remove layers of iterations by calculating the position of
each scanner as I would arrive to it by using modulo math. This got me down
to 10 seconds runtime. Not bad...

## Problem Description

### Part 1

You need to cross a vast firewall. The firewall consists of several layers,
each with a security scanner that moves back and forth across the layer. To
succeed, you must not be detected by a scanner.

By studying the firewall briefly, you are able to record (in your puzzle
input) the depth of each layer and the range of the scanning area for the
scanner within it, written as depth: range. Each layer has a thickness of
exactly 1. A layer at depth 0 begins immediately inside the firewall; a layer
at depth 1 would start immediately after that.

For example, suppose you've recorded the following:

```
0: 3
1: 2
4: 4
6: 4
```

This means that there is a layer immediately inside the firewall (with range
3), a second layer immediately after that (with range 2), a third layer which
begins at depth 4 (with range 4), and a fourth layer which begins at depth
6 (also with range 4). Visually, it might look like this:

```
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
[ ] [ ] ... ... [ ] ... [ ]
[ ] [ ]         [ ]     [ ]
[ ]             [ ]     [ ]
                [ ]     [ ]
```

Within each layer, a security scanner moves back and forth within its range.
Each security scanner starts at the top and moves down until it reaches the
bottom, then moves up until it reaches the top, and repeats. A security
scanner takes one picosecond to move one step. Drawing scanners as S, the
first few picoseconds look like this:

```
Picosecond 0:
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
[S] [S] ... ... [S] ... [S]
[ ] [ ]         [ ]     [ ]
[ ]             [ ]     [ ]
                [ ]     [ ]

Picosecond 1:
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
[ ] [ ] ... ... [ ] ... [ ]
[S] [S]         [S]     [S]
[ ]             [ ]     [ ]
                [ ]     [ ]

Picosecond 2:
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
[ ] [S] ... ... [ ] ... [ ]
[ ] [ ]         [ ]     [ ]
[S]             [S]     [S]
                [ ]     [ ]

Picosecond 3:
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
[ ] [ ] ... ... [ ] ... [ ]
[S] [S]         [ ]     [ ]
[ ]             [ ]     [ ]
                [S]     [S]
```

Your plan is to hitch a ride on a packet about to move through the firewall.
The packet will travel along the top of each layer, and it moves at one layer
per picosecond. Each picosecond, the packet moves one layer forward (its first
move takes it into layer 0), and then the scanners move one step. If there is
a scanner at the top of the layer as your packet enters it, you are caught.
(If a scanner moves into the top of its layer while you are there, you are not
caught: it doesn't have time to notice you before you leave.) If you were to
do this in the configuration above, marking your current position with
parentheses, your passage through the firewall would look like this:

```

```

In this situation, you are caught in layers 0 and 6, because your packet
entered the layer when its scanner was at the top when you entered it. You are
not caught in layer 1, since the scanner moved into the top of the layer once
you were already there.

The severity of getting caught on a layer is equal to its depth multiplied by
its range. (Ignore layers in which you do not get caught.) The severity of the
whole trip is the sum of these values. In the example above, the trip severity
is 0*3 + 6*4 = 24.

Given the details of the firewall you've recorded, if you leave immediately,
what is the severity of your whole trip?

### Part 2

Now, you need to pass through the firewall without being caught - easier said
than done.

You can't control the speed of the packet, but you can delay it any number of
picoseconds. For each picosecond you delay the packet before beginning your
trip, all security scanners move one step. You're not in the firewall during
this time; you don't enter layer 0 until you stop delaying the packet.

In the example above, if you delay 10 picoseconds (picoseconds 0 - 9), you
won't get caught:

```
State after delaying:
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
[ ] [S] ... ... [ ] ... [ ]
[ ] [ ]         [ ]     [ ]

Because all smaller delays would get you caught, the fewest number of
picoseconds you would need to delay to get through safely is 10.

What is the fewest number of picoseconds that you need to delay the packet to
pass through the firewall without being caught?
